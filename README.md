This project investigates facial asymmetry using Kinect v2 and a webcam for data collection. During balance system surgery, the facial nerve is severed and part of the face is paralyzed. The goal of this project is to create an application that would help doctors classify the degree of disability of a patient. The recording devices track specific points on the human face. Based on these points, the patient can be classified. 

The first part focuses on the graphical user interface created in Matlab environment. This GUI is used to control the whole recording process and to retrieve data.

The second part of the work was to evaluate the obtained data using statistical methods. The aim of this part was to reduce the number of points used because many of them are not applicable.

The last part was classification using machine learning. Due to the low number of records, it is able to classify whether the patient is healthy or paralyzed.

In the future I would like to get more data to evaluate and try to use fuzzy logic to classify into more than two groups.
